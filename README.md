Illegal and overfishing is a major threat to marine biodiversity. Illegal fishing causes loss to small countries’s revenue. Worldwide illegal fishing causes 65 Billion US dollars. Some fishing companies catch endangered species and causes biodiversity loss. 

We have developed small conveyor belt sorting machine which uses IBM watson AI and IBM Hyperleder blockchain. This machine can be put on fishing vessel, here fish are placed on conveyor belt, esp32 microcontroller camera takes photos and IBM watson AI model identifies fish species as well as fish diseases.  We have trained model using different fish photos. These details are then saved in hyperledger blockchain. AI model also checks color of fish to see if its affected by any diseases like bacterial infection or fungus. Also gps sensor of esp32 gets location details like longitude and latitude and records on blockchain. Blockchain details can be tracked by all stakeholders like government, Fishing agencies, and so on. Hence by checking fish species, location and time details government can track fishing activities.  A website account stores company’s fishing records. 

We have used IBM Watson AI  studio, node js server, IBM hyperledger and esp32 microcontroller and camera and then connected them on  conveyor belt machine from our local college.
